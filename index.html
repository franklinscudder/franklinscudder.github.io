			<p><h1>Welcome to the Simple Vape Calculator by FranklinScudder!</h1></p>
			<p>
			This page provides a few simple calculators to answer common questions about whether your choice of battery and coil is likely to be safe and appropriate.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you're trying to decide which battery to buy for your vape, head over to 
			<a href="https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/blogs/mooch.256958/" target="_blank">Mooch's battery blog</a> for the best advice.
			<br>
			<br>
			These calculators assume you are using standard Lithium-Ion batteries such as 18650s, 21700s, 20700s, 18350s etc. I.e. It is assumed that your batteries have a nominal
			voltage of 3.7v and a maximum voltage range of 3.2v to 4.2v.

			<h2> "What is CDR?" </h2>
			<p> CDR (Continuous Discharge Rating) is the maximum current (Amps) that a battery can safely deliver. Manufacturers will supply a value of CDR for their
				products but this is sometimes inaccurate. For a reliable value of CDR, it is recommended to consult Mooch's database of battery test results. This can be
				accessed <a href="https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/blogs/mooch.256958/" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<div id="coils" class="text">
			<h2> "Which resistance value should I use?" </h2>
			<p> These calculators need the effective installed resistance of your coil(s). This is the resistance that your mod sees when the coil(s) is installed in the atomiser
			and ready to vape. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			To find this resistance, simply install your coil(s) as you intend to use them, then use a mod or multimeter to read the resistance of the built 
			atomiser. This eliminates any complications in coil variations, multi-coil configurations and extra resistance caused by the atomiser or 510 connector.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="regulation" class="text">
			<h2> "Is my device regulated?" </h2>
			<p> Can you select a power (wattage) on your device? If you can it is regulated as the mod will control the power coming from your batteries to match the 
			value you have selected. If you can't, then it is most likely unregulated meaning the power going into the coil is whatever your batteries can provide.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Some unregulated mods (mostly 'mechanical' mods) have absolutely ZERO protections built in and therefore should be used with great caution by users who fully
			understand the theory and practical guidelines that must be followed when using them.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="batteries" class="text">
			<h2> "But what about this mAh number?" </h2>
			<p> Individual batteries (at least when it comes to vaping) can be described by three basic numbers: Voltage (Volts), CDR (Amps) and Capacity (mAh). To explain the
			meanings of these numbers intuitively, imagine your vape is a water wheel that you're trying to turn by dropping water on it from a bucket (your battery). 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Voltage describes how high above the water wheel you hold the bucket when you pour. Holding it just above the wheel will mean that each millilitre of water hitting the wheel hasn't 
			fallen far and so does not give the wheel much energy when it hits it. Holding the bucket high up above the wheel however will mean that the water falls a long way onto the
			wheel and picks up a lot of speed and so turns the wheel faster. So the more voltage your battery has, the more energy each it will deliver to your vape.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			In this analogy, CDR corresponds to how big of a spout the bucket has. It is a measure of how much water you can tip out of the bucket every second, with more water meaning 
			more energy given to the water wheel.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Capacity is the easiest concept to understand of the three, it simply means how big the bucket is. Low capacity will mean you run out of water more quickly so for
			a vape battery you want the highest capacity you can get (so long as the voltage and CDR are correct). This will mean you can keep vaping longer without having to charge.
